Soul magic awaits
- explains what soul magic is
- ends off with telling you what a spirit is

Within this world, every living body has a soul. The body is a physical vessel that the soul occupies. The soul is one's consciousness and what animates the body. It is an arcane image of who you are.
The encyclopedia arcana is a book meant to explain everything about the soul and how to potentially utilize various soul magics. Even though a soul is an arcane thing, performing soul magic is not easy.
To properly utilize soul magics you're gonna need to separate the desired magic elements from all the other junk found within a soul. These magic elements are known as spirits, magical fragments of potential.
The magical presence of a soul derives entirely from the spirits found within it. Each soul is made unique by what spirits it holds, it's safe to assume that the soul is only alive due to them too!

"What exactly is a spirit?" You might ask yourself. Spirits are raw, untainted magic. There are also many spirit types, all with unique uses and abilities. Perfect for your evil needs.
Each soul contains a specific set of spirits, different souls contain different combinations of spirits! When hunting for spirits you'll have to carefully think about which souls will have what you need.
When hunting spirits it is important to not leave any of them behind. Uncollected spirits will slowly dissolve into the world around and alter it into a new twisted one. Many natural wonders you may find were created this way!

- explains how runewood trees are created
- explains how to get holy extract out of runewood trees

The runewood tree is yet another result of spirits dissolving into nature. These trees can be most frequently found within plains, while also rarely appearing in forests.
When sacred and arcane spirits are infused into oak the properties of the wood will be altered and runewood will be created. This volatile process is how runewood trees are created, with the right tools you'll be able to replicate it!
Within the runewood trees a special type of sap is born. To get your hands on this holy extract you'll need to strip away the bark off of exposed logs and then bottle up all the sap you can get!
Holy extract can be used for quite a few things. Firstly, by combining it with a slimeball you'll obtain sapballs effectively providing you with three times as much slime! Secondly, you can create holy syrup by heating up your holy extract in a furnace.
Drinking this rejuvenating drink will replenish plenty of hunger and clear you of certain negative effects. Additionally if you drink it during day time health will also be restored and you'll gain a regenerative effect.

Try your best to not think about reverting sapballs into slimeballs using a certain expansion mod!
Soulstone

The soulstone is a strange ore found both on the surface and in the deepest ends of every cave. The ore itself was created from carelessness, when a dissolved spirit merges with ore it'll shape the mineral to be something new. Soulstone is extremely valuable to any soul hunter.
Soulstone is very precious due to it's ability to resonate and mangle with souls and spirits in various ways. This unique ability of the soulstone makes it the perfect mineral to create soul hunting equipment. Any weapon made out of soulstone is most certainly sufficient for damaging an opponent's soul.
