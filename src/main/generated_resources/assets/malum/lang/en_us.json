  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.aerial_spirit_b": "Aerial magics, light and versatile, weak in effect yet excel in utility. Any nimble body is bound to have or develop aerial spirit within their soul.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.aquatic_spirit_a": "Similar to the earthen, aquatic magics are immensely powerful. On top of that, the oceans in this world seem to have lots of spirit unrelated magics already within them!",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.aquatic_spirit_b": "Aquatic magic derives a lot from various ocean wonders already present in the world. Ideas such as channeling or loyalty are one with the seas and everything within. Aquatic spirit provides similar powers.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_spirit_a": "The arcane spirit is magic in it's purest form. Arcane spirit is often needed to fully utilize the potential stored within other spirits, it has little power alone but can greatly amplify other magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_spirit_b": "Spirits found in a soul aren't always set in stone when a vessel is created. For example, it is rumored that the very first illagers were villagers who broke their oath and turned evil. If that is the case, their soul would've adapted and became completely wicked.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_spirit_c": "A similar process most likely happened when a apprentice witch became proficient enough in magics. Souls can develop spirits over a long period of time based on how the body reacts to magic. This is very often the case with arcane spirit due to how pure and frequent it is in the world. Arcane Spirit is found within the supernatural.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.earthen_spirit_a": "Earthen magic can be seen as two separate things merged into one, nature and strength. The magic is incredibly potent even when used in small amounts!",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.earthen_spirit_b": "With the power of the earth you can do quite a lot. For one, earthen spirit is perfect for creating strong and durable gear. For two, it's natural properties open up many opportunities in spell crafting. Earthen spirit is found within the strong and the giving.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_a": "Nowadays most magics offer you a unique magical source of light for all purpose use, spirit magics are no different. Ether, alternatively known as Nitor is a magical flame that burns and shines bright forever. It can be placed on a torch or an arcane rock brazier which can be placed or hanged.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_b": "Additionally, the ether flame can be dyed into practically any color. Simply combine the ether item with any combination of dyes and it's color will be altered! For various reasons monochromatic dyes may yield possibly undesirable results without other dyes mixed in.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hallowed_gold_a": "Gold is very often used as a basis for various magics, this is also the case with spirit magic. Infusing arcane and sacred spirits into a gold ingot will imbue it with magic and yield a much more desirable magic metal. A few additional reagents are also needed for this process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hallowed_gold_b": "While not too useful in causing harm or crafting powerful gear, hallowed gold is a metal perfect for spirit manipulation.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.haunted": "The haunted enchantment utilizes magic created when a soulstone is brought close to a hurt soul to deal extra magic damage to anyone you strike! Higher tiers hit with even stronger magic",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hex_ash": "Hex ash is a simple magical powder used in creating various magical items. The ash can animate things, bring them to life in some extreme cases even. It's crated by infusing gunpowder with arcane spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_a": "Hellish magic is incredibly dangerous. PLaying with fire is never a good idea especially when spirit magic is involved.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_b": "The forever on fire hellish nether, it's a surprise that life exists there. Infernal spirit derives almost entirely from the anomaly that is the nether and everything that lives in it. Certain souls found within the overworld also hold infernal spirit due to their explosive nature or a strong fire resistance.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_a": "Within this world exists an arcane phenomenon, spirits. A spirit is a magical property or element depending on how you look at it that makes up souls. The soul is an arcane image or representation of every sentient being. The body is merely a physical vessel for the soul.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_b": "Soul magic is a quite complex field with a simpler predecessor: spirit magic. Spirit magic is a much easier way to access most of the arcane phenomenon that derive from the soul. To put it short, soul magic almost entirely derives from the spirits within a soul and by extension spirits alone can be utilized for magic!",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_c": "Getting your power hungry hands on some magical spirits may not be so simple though. When a body dies it leaves behind various items and precious loot, likewise when a soul is shattered it bursts out into magical spirit. This brutal way of completely eradicating both the body and the soul from existence is the main way of obtaining spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_a": "In contrast to most other magical lights aside from pleasing the eye ether has a double flame colored variant, iridescent ether. This pristine form of ether allows you to dye the item once more to alter the ending color of the burn. Much like normal ether it can be placed on a brazier and a torch",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_b": "Getting just the right coloring for your light may be a bit tricky however. You cannot alter the original color of ether once it's transformed into it's iridescent variant, applying any dye at this stage will only change the second color.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.rebound": "The rebound enchantment is by far the strangest one of them all. It grants you the ability to throw the scythe like a boomerang, allowing for a wacky ranged attack. Higher tiers allow you to throw the scythe more frequently.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_a": "The runewood tree is yet another result of spirits dissolving into nature. When an oak tree is touched by infernal or more rarely arcane spirit it quickly takes on a new appearance, it seems to appear most commonly within open plains and forests. Some call this type of tree arcane oak.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_b": "Runewood is perfect for a magic conductor or relay of sorts, it works very well for any arcane craft really.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_a": "Sacred spirit represents two things, the pure and the holy. Magic derived from sacred spirits is generally focused on various forms of healing and other positive effects.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_b": "When you're in need of a specific spirit you'll need to do some thinking. It'd be boring if the solution was handed out to you right away! Each soul has very specific spirits and their types depend on what kind of soul it is. The sacred spirit for example is found mainly within passive, relaxed souls.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_a": "A scythe is a weapon of magic origin designed for cutting through hordes of enemies. The axe exchanges attack speed for extra damage, the scythe on the other hand gains crowd control. Any attack done with the scythe will count as a stronger version of a sword's sweep attack.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_b": "The scythe is also the most important tool of a spirit hunter, it's excellence at crowd control combined with it's ability to shatter souls makes it the perfect weapon for hunting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_c": "The simplest scythe you can make uses iron for it's blade and a basic soulstone as a reagent. The scythe also accepts many exclusive enchantments!",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.solar_sap_a": "The runewood tree often grows with a special sap in it! The mixture known as solar sap naturally flows through the arcane oak and can easily be harvested. To harvest sap you need to locate some sap filled runewood, strip the bark off with an axe and then use a bottle to store the sap.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.solar_sap_b": "Solar sap has some select uses, mainly solar syrup and solar sapballs. Solar syrup is a delicious mixture you can obtain my heating up solar sap in a furnace. This rejuvenating drink will restore health atop hunger and provide a regenerative effect. Combining solar sap with slimeballs will yield sapballs, an alternative to slime.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.solar_sap_c": "...There's probably some technology out there that would allow you to remove the magic from sapballs and turn them back into slime, best not to worry about that.",
